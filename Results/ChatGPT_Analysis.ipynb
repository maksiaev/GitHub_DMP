      "p. 524: Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order that, at its core, affects how one perceives and socializes with others (Durand, in press). DSM-5 combined most of the disorders previously included under the umbrella term \"pervasive develop-mental disorders\" (e.g., autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and childhood disintegrative disorder) and included them into this one category (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Moreover, Rett disorder, a genetic condition that affects mostly females, is diagnosed as ASD with the qualifier \"associated with Rett syndrome\" or \"associated with MeCP2 mutation\" (the gene involved in Rett syndrome). And the designation \"not otherwise specified\" which was applied to other disorders prior to DSM-5, was deleted. A disorder new to DSM-5-Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder-includes the difficulties in social communication seen in ASD, but without restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. These individuals do not easily learn the social rules when communicating with others (e.g., interrupting, talking too loud, not listening to others). Certain individuals previously diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified may fall into this category.\n"
